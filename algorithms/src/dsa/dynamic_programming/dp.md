## Optimal substructure:
The optimal solution can be easily constructured efficiently from optimal 
solutions of its sub-problems.

In other word, the sub-solution of an optimal solution is the optimal solution 
of the corresponding sub-problem.

## Overlapping sub-problems
This leads to caching, and thus save time.
This leads to result selection, such as min, max, etc.
